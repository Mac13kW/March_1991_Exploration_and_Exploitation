# This is a recreation of the computational model from March JG. 1991. Exploration
# and Exploitation in Organizational Learning, Organization Science. 2(1):71-87
# The model has been recreated without access to the original code. The purpose
# of the recreation was to assess the ease of reproducing the original results.

# Technical notes:
# Interestingly, the original code cannot be followed exactly as described in
# the paper. The text says that the simulation runs until it reaches a steady state,
# i.e., "at which all individuals and the code share the same (not necesarilly
# accurate) beliefe with respect to each dimension" p. 75
# However, because individuals don't learn when code is 0 and the code only learns 
# from superior individuals (page 74), it is possible that such equilibrium
# will never be reached. Consider reality R[-1, 1, -1, 1], C[0, 1, 1, 1], and
# all Individuals are I[1, 1, 1, 1]. No further learning is possible and there
# will be no convergence in beliefs between the individuals and the code

# The code reproduces Figure 1. but to a different scaling (does not reach the
# 0.95 value). This is a well known problem with that model - it is relatively
# easy to reproduce the code, but difficult to reproduce the figures. Doing
# requires making additional assumptions that cannot be found in the paper itself.

# FUNCTIONS ----------

getvote <- function(v) {
  # The purpose of this function is to produce a vote (majority belief of the
  # individuals with superior knowledge compared with the code) and the
  # difference between the two votes (k). 
  # Here I assume that the individuals with beliefs = 0 do not vote (abstain),
  # which is a natural proposition when viewed from the political science
  # perspective (if one doesn't have an opinion about a certain dimension, 
  # one abstains from the vote).
  # Specifically, the function takes a vector (v) of arbitrary length and
  # produces the majority vote and advantage over the second choice. It only
  # works with two non-neutral (not 0) beliefs. It can be generalized to more
  # values, but further assumption about the rate of code learning (effect of n
  # and k) need to be made.
  uniqv <- sort(unique(v[v!=0]))  # only sort the non 0 elements
  freq <- tabulate(match(v, uniqv))  # find number of occurences
  indx_max <- which(freq == max(freq))
  k <- max(freq) - min(freq)
  if(length(uniqv) == 1) {
    # Here we need to eliminate an situation where with only one vote
    # the max == min and thus k would be 0 (no code learning)
    k <- max(freq)
  }
  output_ = c(uniqv[indx_max], k)
  return(output_)
